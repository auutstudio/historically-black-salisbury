# Salisbury, MD on the Eastern Shore

[auut studio](https://findauut.com/maps/) and [Dr. Charles Chavis, Jr.](https://thesilentshore.org/book/dr-charles-chavis/) are releasing the geospatial data we assembled for an exhibit on the historical neighborhoods of Georgetown, Cuba, California, and Jersey. These neighborhoods were situated in Salisbury, Maryland, Wicomico County in the first half of the 20th century.

The files include streets, railways, and building footprints for parts of Salisbury in the scope of the exhibit. These were created by georeferencing the scanned archival images from the [March 1931 Sanborn Fire Insurance map of Salisbury, MD](https://www.loc.gov/item/sanborn03651_009/), as available at the Library of Congress. These were manually composited to a single image and then their historic information was aligned in QGIS onto modern geographic coordinates (WGS84).
